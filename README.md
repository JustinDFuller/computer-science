Solving problems in different languages. Mostly from [codewars](https://codewars.com).

## Formulas and Patterns for solving algorithms

### Pattern Variations

Always include test cases for these standard pattern variations. These can apply to any iterable like a string or array (even numbers).

1. Empty pattern ("")
2. Single pattern ("A")
3. No pattern ("ABCDE")
4. All pattern ("AAAAA")
5. Starting pattern ("AAABCD")
6. Ending pattern ("ABCDDDD")
7. Middle pattern ("ABCCCDE")
8. Repeating pattern ("ABCABC")

### Formulas

1. Brute force: create all permutations of the thing.

Loop over the string, number, or array to find every permutation. Check every permutation for the thing. This may involve 3 loops: loop over the iterable, loop again from each starting point, potentially loop over again if you need to check the contents of each permutation (like duplicates).

_Algorithmic Complexity:_ Exponential.
